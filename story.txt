There once was a man named Steve who really enjoyed eating apples. One day, he stumbled upon a golden apple.

This apple was shiny, and heavy. He thought to give it a bite, but he couldn't mark it with his teeth. So he brought it to his house
where he had many tools to see what was inside this apple. He could not contain his curiosity, and he needed to find out for himself.
