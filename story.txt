There once was a man named Steve who really enjoyed eating apples. One day, he stumbled upon a golden apple.

This apple was unlike any other apple he had ever seen. He tried to pick it up with one hand, but he needed both hands and most of his upper body strength to lift and carry it. He took is back to his house, by his utter will power, and began inspecting the apple. It glistened a beautiful golden color, too real to be fake. The sheer weight of the apple was enough to make Steve believe it was really made of gold. "But was it solid?", he asked himself. He repositioned the apple to the garage where he had access to a steel-cutting tool. He needed to know whether the apple was solid gold or not.
